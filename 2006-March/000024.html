<PRE>He Vincent,

Sorry for the delay, at the moment its quite hectic because I'm doing 
some projects besides work and Simuze.

Oh, MySQL 5 is very interesting, but for our purposes I think we don't 
need the new features of MySQL 5 so thats also part of the reason to 
stick with 4.x

I've been looking into some info about the way that we can handle these 
things without re-inventing the wheel over and over again, maybe we 
should investigate our options a bit more widely and see if there are 
any nicely coded and not too bloated frameworks (Symphony?) or libs that 
can help us with this. On the other hand its also very nice if we can 
setup a system that does exactly as we wish and not be (too) depended on 
external parties.

As for your class diagram and your code I'll look into it tonight, as I 
am now typing this in the train and I don't have any WiFi..so I can't 
check it right now.

I agree on the name issue. Lets go for more logical and rename the class 
to HTMLWriter instead of WriterHTML. I used the latter to make clear its 
an extension of the Writer class, but its confusing..so we change it :)

My idea about a session/user class is that we basically should have only 
one global var in the session that handles everything that has to do 
with Simuze. Ie this global var contains all the instances we would 
need..but maybe we should test this first.

ps: Digest means that you will get all the emails of one day in one 
email instead of each email seperately. You can change this option as 
you see fit.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ha Vincent,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, I still want to use php5. My versions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - php5 (5.05 on Linux)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - php5 (5.04 on OS X)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Phpdoc 1.3.0RC5
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - PHPUnit2 (version 2.3.4 on Linux via PEAR)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - MySQL database (4.1.12)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not completly sure on the db part if we should start using the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more usefull, but also more 'high-tech' features of MySQL or that we 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should try to stay quite simple so we/others can also very easily 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change databases...For now I would say we can focus on mysql4.1 as the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> latest version. Version 5 is already there, but as far as I know not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as widespread yet for shared hosts etc. And I would like to make 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Simuze as accessible as possible (otherwise I would have built it on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ruby on Rails :))
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grtz
