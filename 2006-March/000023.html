<PRE>Hej Bjorn,

I now roughly have the same versions as you do. Version 5 of mysql is indeed 
not very widespread, but you don't see php5 everywhere either. But as long 
as mysql 4.1 will be enough, we can use it.

The input class is not in my favor anymore. If one would use the input class 
to put data into the database, which class would he use to get data out of 
the database? I'm searching for a simple basic object model, but I'm 
starting to think that's not possible. Anyway, I've put a quickly drawn 
class diagram on the wiki and a very limited validation class in the svn 
repository. The class diagram seems messy (and it is), nearly no relations 
are drawn and I hope I used the right symbols and all, but it's a start. By 
the way, your code says WriterHTML but in a later mail you said HTMLWriter. 
The latter seems more obvious, what's the official name? Also, I figured the 
Writer class could also be extended by a EmailWriter class.

What are your ideas about a user/session class? And there also has to be a 
class for accessing properties of other users. What are you thinking?

greetings, Vincent

PS. I want to change my email-address in the simuze-hackers list, should I 
just unsubscribe and then subscribe with my new emailaddress? I'll be in the 
digested members list if I do that, don't know what that means.

&gt;<i> Ha Vincent,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I still want to use php5. My versions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - php5 (5.05 on Linux)
</I>&gt;<i> - php5 (5.04 on OS X)
</I>&gt;<i> - Phpdoc 1.3.0RC5
</I>&gt;<i> - PHPUnit2 (version 2.3.4 on Linux via PEAR)
</I>&gt;<i> - MySQL database (4.1.12)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not completly sure on the db part if we should start using the more 
</I>&gt;<i> usefull, but also more 'high-tech' features of MySQL or that we should try 
</I>&gt;<i> to stay quite simple so we/others can also very easily change 
</I>&gt;<i> databases...For now I would say we can focus on mysql4.1 as the latest 
</I>&gt;<i> version. Version 5 is already there, but as far as I know not as 
</I>&gt;<i> widespread yet for shared hosts etc. And I would like to make Simuze as 
</I>&gt;<i> accessible as possible (otherwise I would have built it on Ruby on Rails 
</I>&gt;<i> :))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> grtz
