<PRE>Hi Bjorn and others,

How's life? Development is quite dead. As for my great Pistache: it was once
my stupid dream and wont become much more probably. But, Simuze2 must be
realised! It apparently doesn't work when there is no deadline (I keep
thinking: &quot;I will start tomorrow&quot; - but offcourse I don't). So, Simuze2 is
now a school project of mine (software engineering), putting some pressure
to it. I finally found a framework that I like (CakePHP, Symfony etc are too
complicated to make things easier): Code Igniter. Its base is a loosely
defined MVC system (models aren't required, for one). I'm now thinking which
views, models and controllers we need. But first, I want your opinion about
the user-system of simuze2. My idea: seperate user from artist. Not all
users are musicians, some users are member of multiple bands, bands can have
multiple users to manage its content. For the sake of clarity, usernames are
simply name and surname. You probably heard of OpenID, offcourse we need
simuze2 to support it (a php library is available). In fact, it should be
the only way to login. As people can have multiple OpenID's (not that much
people do), a user should be able to authenticate him/herself with different
OpenID's. If they do want this, upon first attempt a email is send to
confirm the OpenID (granting access for this OpenID).

When a user has created a new artist in Simuze2 (or music group, but neither
one of this names is suitable for every situation), he can invite new or
existing users to join the group. The first user is some sort of admin.

Please let me know what you want to do, or what you want me to do ;)

Grtz, Vincent
