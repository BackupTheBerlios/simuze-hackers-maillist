<PRE>Hey Bjorn,

Nothing but silence lately, sorry. I'm working on my own CMS.. I know I  
shouldn't be developing yet another CMS because &quot;mine obviously can and  
will be better&quot; instead of improving some of the great CMS's (Drupal for  
instance). Probably, I'm just too stubborn. Anyway, during the last past  
weeks I've managed to think up a system that is really flexible. Without  
being a self-advertiser, it's true. I won't go into detail about it,  
partially because it's partially still a concept, and also because I don't  
want to disturb you with yet another reinvented wheel. But, here it comes,  
Simuze v2 could be brought to life easily, on top of Pistache CMS (as I  
temporarily named it). With the Symphony framework it would not be as  
easy. You might not agree on my ideas, sadly I can't think up a better way  
for Simuze v2 to awake. I don't know how you visualise Simuze v2 right  
now, but I guess I already chose my path.

Grtz, Vince.

PS. The classification 'CMS' doesn't represent what it really is, but I  
have yet to come up with a better one.

</PRE>
