What's happening on Simuze v2? The repository is still empty, nothing new on the wiki... What's the plan? Or should I just start coding?

Greetings, Vincent

Hi Vincent,

Good question :)

I have been working on several things that are related with the 
development of Simuze v2. Mostly on how to use phpDocumentor and PhpUnit 
   (PEAR). I'm working on documenting my efforts in this and submitting 
some first lines of code to the svn repos. I'm thinking of not 
submitting simuze v1 anymore, because Simuze v2 will be fundamentally 
different and (hopefully) better.

Would you be interested in working on creating a validation class which 
we can use to automagically validate user input before using it further?

ps: Our mail was down and I missed this email completly, I apologize for 
the delay!

Sorry, I was almost thinking that nothing was happening ;).

Okay, I'll start with a validation class. I guess there should be validation 
for email-adresses, urls and input lengths? And should I send you my code 
via email, I hope that doesn't screw up intendation and such.

Subject: [Simuze-hackers] validation class
Message-ID: <002701c6372a$7e7d8ff0$9800000a@okl>

Hi Bjorn,

I thought if Simuze v2 is going to be very object oriented, we could write a class that writes html forms and make it possible to integrate that with the validation class. If user-input isn't valid, the validation object passes the form back to the 'form writer' including the errors. That way, including forms on pages becomes a piece of cake. Instead of validating each field for every form with ten lines of code, you'd validate the whole form at once with one line of code. This is all maybe a bit vague, but tell me what you think.

Greetings, Vincent

Message-ID: <43FCE9FA.60300@simuze.nl>

Vincent et all,

I have imported my stuff so far (almost nothing) into the svn repos at 
berlios. Have a look. You can check it out using the info from this page:

https://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=4728

As for the structure (for now..):

/setup -> will contain setup and config files in the future
/img -> will contain images...future..
/js -> will contain javascript files
/css -> will contain css stylesheets
/library -> contains classes
   /tests -> contains PHPUNIT test files for each class	

Please send me your unix name for Berlios so I can add you to the 
project. I will try to write some decent info about how to use PHPUNIT 
and PHPDocumentor in developing for Simuze and add it to wiki in order 
to make developing more structured...I hope ;)

grtz

Hi Bjorn,

My name on Berlios is "t22". Don't ask why :). I've taken a quick look at your code, mostly comments though ;). The syntax and all for phpdocumentor seems pretty straight-forward. But phpunit doesn't, so I'm keeping an eye on the wiki. And about subversion: that's new to me, I'll read some manual later on. I didn't face any problems so far with subversion.

For the sake of clarity, I figured that we should use an input and an output class. Some layer in between is a good idea, because the input and output classes probably need to share some methods (validation, conversion, etc). So that is going to be another class. Using these three classes developers can use an 'open core' to develop extensions using functions offered by the simuze core.

This is the structure of the classes with their methods and extended classes etc, how it's stored in my head right now.

Input class
- Form (or maybe some general class that accepts arrays..?)
- Database
- File

Output class
- Writer
- - HTMLWriter (including a method to write a form)
- - RSSWriter
- - etc
- Email

'In between' class
- validation
- conversion (for audio files etc)
- encoding

So, for example, when putting a form on page:

- A form will be written using HTMLWriter
- When submitted by user, the Form class handles the data
- Bad user input? Toss it back to HTMLWriter
- Good user input? Save it via the Database or File class

Well, I was just thinking.

Greetings, Vincent

Vincent,

I added you to the Simuze group. Welcome :)

Your right about my code...its a lot comments, but for a good reason ;).

I now know how to handle phpdocumentor and phpunit. It would be useful 
to know what kind of setup you are using for development and testing. I 
use OS X (tiger) and Ubuntu Linux (5.10). Its fairly easy to install 
phpunit and phpdocumentor using PEAR on these...if you are using Windows 
it might be a little bit harder, but it should be possible to use 
phpunit and phpdocumentor as well. By using these two we can generate 
development docs very quickly and use phpunit in order to create tests 
that will test our classes and make sure they will work as we have 
planned, even when we refactor ;). In the long run this *hopefully* 
helps us maintain a structured codebase with up-to-date development 
docs, but it seems it will make development also a bit slower..

Here are some links with info that might help us out:

- online Subversion manual/book
http://svnbook.org/

- online Php Unit book (I'm still learning this as well..)
http://www.phpunit.de/pocket_guide/index.en.php

- phpdocumentor site
http://www.phpdoc.org/

I like your ideas about the layer structure, maybe we should draw it so 
we can more easily see how it will work with other classes?

Btw I really like the book advanced PHP Programming by George 
Schlossnagle. It contains a ton of information about php5 programming 
and doing it 'right'.

I'm using Windows XP pro, this evening I will install phpunit and 
phpdocumentor. Also, next week = vacation, so I've got enough time to dive 
into phpunit and phpdocumentor.

That's probably something you learn in college, because I don't know how 
(I've read something about UML though). But visualising things always helps. 
And thanks for the links and the book, I'd better start reading ;).

Greetings, Vincent

PS. maybe it's a good idea to disable the ability for wiki visitors to 
create an account, because the wiki is already being spammed...

Hi Bjorn,

You mentioned some time you wanted to do it in php5. Is this still the case? Because then I should get me php 5 and phpunit2. And I assume you're using the latest stable phpdocumenter.

Ha Vincent,

Yeah, I still want to use php5. My versions:

- php5 (5.05 on Linux)
- php5 (5.04 on OS X)
- Phpdoc 1.3.0RC5
- PHPUnit2 (version 2.3.4 on Linux via PEAR)
- MySQL database (4.1.12)

I'm not completly sure on the db part if we should start using the more 
usefull, but also more 'high-tech' features of MySQL or that we should 
try to stay quite simple so we/others can also very easily change 
databases...For now I would say we can focus on mysql4.1 as the latest 
version. Version 5 is already there, but as far as I know not as 
widespread yet for shared hosts etc. And I would like to make Simuze as 
accessible as possible (otherwise I would have built it on Ruby on Rails :))
