Hey Bjorn,

Nothing but silence lately, sorry. I'm working on my own CMS.. I know I  
shouldn't be developing yet another CMS because "mine obviously can and  
will be better" instead of improving some of the great CMS's (Drupal for  
instance). Probably, I'm just too stubborn. Anyway, during the last past  
weeks I've managed to think up a system that is really flexible. Without  
being a self-advertiser, it's true. I won't go into detail about it,  
partially because it's partially still a concept, and also because I don't  
want to disturb you with yet another reinvented wheel. But, here it comes,  
Simuze v2 could be brought to life easily, on top of Pistache CMS (as I  
temporarily named it). With the Symphony framework it would not be as  
easy. You might not agree on my ideas, sadly I can't think up a better way  
for Simuze v2 to awake. I don't know how you visualise Simuze v2 right  
now, but I guess I already chose my path.

Grtz, Vince.

PS. The classification 'CMS' doesn't represent what it really is, but I  
have yet to come up with a better one.

You make me very curious...where can we see this system in action?

For now, it's only available to me, as the actual coding is no way near  
finished. I've taken a lot of time just to draw the concept. And this  
concept is done for lets say 75%. At this moment, I have to find a proper  
templating system. Smarty is cool, but not suitable for Pistache. XSL  
seems way to complicated, although it fit's my needs better than Smarty.  
Yet again, I choose my own system.

As with more CMS's, Pistache content is hierachially structured. The nodes  
can be articles, comments, products, but also files (most CMS's separate  
files from other content, I don't like it). Their metadata requirements  
and templates are specified by a content type (similar to the eZ Publish  
CMS). You can request the nodes per URL. URL's must be:
- meaningfull to the user (human readable)
- a reflection of the site's structure
- navigable (by chopping off the last part of a URL, you should end up one  
level higher in the site).
Therefore, the nodes all have a path. So, with the URL  
'pistache.nl/articles/introduction' you request the node having the path  
'/articles/introduction'. Using an extended XPath-query (XPath doesn't  
support sorting, Pistache does. Also, with Pistache you can feed a node  
dynamic data), you can be very specific.

URL: 'pistache.nl/articles/@author==T22'
Returns nodeset of all children of '/articles', where the author is T22.

Next thing: the use of content types.
URL: 'pistache.nl/articles/@author==T22.rss'
Returns RSS feed of all children of '/articles', where the author is T22.

The template of content-type 'rss' will look something like this  
(simplified):

<rss>		
<channel>
<title>{@title}</title>
<link>{$url}</link>
<description>{@description}</description>
<pistache path="*">
   <item>
     <title>{@title}</title>
     <link>{$url}</link>
     <description>{@description}</description>
     <pubDate>{/$now}</pubDate>
   </item>
</pistache>
</rss>

To clarify, the @ prefix is for an atrribute (a node can have as much  
atrributes/metadata as you want), the $ prefix is for variables. $url is  
not an atrribute stored in the database, but a variable that can change,  
for example when change your domainname. I don't want too much variables  
like $now etc, it has to stay simple. <pistache path="*"></pistache> is a  
loop, for each child an item element is created. Now, a filled template  
(URL: 'pistache.nl/articles/@author==T22.rss').

<rss>		
<channel>
<title>Articles</title>
<link>http://pistache.nl/articles</link>

So.. There is a lot more to talk about (the query language to start with),  
but please give your opinion about this part.

PS. To stay cool, I was thinking of enabling this kind of features:
URL: 'pistache.nl/audio/one.mp3/@title'
This requires an attribute filter/moderator, a plugin that can read ID3  
metadata from a mp3.

A quick follow-up...

The Pistache design changed for the better, to integrate Smarty. But I  
just discovered PHPTAL, another templating system. Pistache is moving,  
slow but steady ;).

grtz, Vincent
