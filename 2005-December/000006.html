<PRE>Hi Vincent,

&gt;<i> Sounds perfectly balanced to me. But, correct me if I'm wrong, if you 
</I>&gt;<i> want to update the playlist, you would need to change the contents of 
</I>&gt;<i> the db and also generate a new XSPF file.
</I>
Yep, thats true. But at this point users cannot change the contents of 
the playlist, so in the end we probably have to investigate what works 
better. For now this seems to work quite well.

&gt;<i> And about the Simuze versions: I didn't know that there are different 
</I>&gt;<i> versions, and what their purpose is.
</I>
Well, this was discussed offlist between Marten and me, so nobody knew 
about it until now ;).

The reason for having two versions is that Simuze v1 is the one that we 
use at http:/www.simuze.nl/live and the Simuze v2 will be its successor.

The differences:

Simuze v1 is made in php4 and more or less hacked together. It works but 
its a pain to maintain or update this version. For example we have glued 
some code between Simuze and Wordpress, created a cron based deamon that 
takes care of the music encoding/anti-virus stuff etc. It works for us, 
we know what to do, but if anybody else wants to help out it's almost 
impossible for them. So we want to maintain version 1 and start with the 
development of version 2 and learn from our misstakes.

Simuze v2 will probably be built in php5 and we will use a more OO based 
approach. One of the things we will do this time is focus on the core 
functionality of Simuze and implement some sort of plugin system for 
everything outside this core.

As you might notice a lot is still open for discussion. I would like to 
discuss this further so any ideas, plans feel free...

&gt;<i> And at this moment the svn 
</I>&gt;<i> repository seems pretty empty. 
</I>
Correct. I made a misstake and this resulted in a not usable SVN repos. 
Berlios helped me out and the SVN repos can be used again. I will import 
Simuze v1 back in again tomorrow and also create a Simuze v2 branch.


Please tell me more about this (or is
&gt;<i> there something on the internet that I can read?)
</I>
There is getting more and more at the Simuze Wiki 
(<A HREF="http://simuze.berlios.de">http://simuze.berlios.de</A>) about the proposed ideas and methodology. 
Feel free to send comments on this list or add your thoughts to the wiki.


&gt;<i> PS. Can you also tell me something about the people involved in Simuze 
</I>&gt;<i> (for example, how many?), if you don't mind?
</I>
No problem.

We started with two: Marten Timan and me. After a while we had some 
people on the old mailinglist who wanted to help out, but we had no idea 
how to do this considering the state of Simuze, so in the end this kinda 
faded away (Can't blame them..) and we're now with three? If you would 
like to help out with Simuze v2 ;)

If you don't mind me asking, can you tell a bit more about yourself like 
skills, preferences, favourite pancake ;)

grtz
BjornW
