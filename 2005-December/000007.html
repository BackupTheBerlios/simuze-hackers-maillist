<PRE>Hi Bjorn,

A couple of months ago I send a email to Marten, describing my interest in 
Simuze and some other stuff. Reading it again now, it sounds a bit to 
enthousiastic. For a couple of months I didn't do anything with Simuze, so 
the best thing is to just forget about that email ;). Anyway, I sorta 
regained my interest and became a member of the simuze-hackers list. I'm 
sorry to hear that there are not so much Simuze developers, but let's try to 
make the best of it.

&gt;<i> The reason for having two versions is that Simuze v1 is the one that we 
</I>&gt;<i> use at http:/www.simuze.nl/live and the Simuze v2 will be its successor.
</I>
What will be the priority? v1 or v2? And will you (or may I say 'we') start 
with v2 from scratch?

&gt;<i> Simuze v2 will probably be built in php5 and we will use a more OO based 
</I>&gt;<i> approach. One of the things we will do this time is focus on the core 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality of Simuze and implement some sort of plugin system for 
</I>&gt;<i> everything outside this core.
</I>
Sounds good, but it's going to take some time...

And this plugin system, couldn't it simply be based on events. For example, 
if someone wants to add a RSS function, he would write this:

----------------------

     $Simuze-&gt;addHandler('onPlaylistUpdate','updateRSS');

     function updateRSS()
     {
          //generate new rss file, etcetera
     }

----------------------

&gt;<i> If you don't mind me asking, can you tell a bit more about yourself like 
</I>&gt;<i> skills, preferences, favourite pancake ;)
</I>
Sure. In short:

I...
- am 17 years old.
- am still at school, Atheneum 5
- used to play drums, nowadays I play in a local percussionband.
- play volleyball, training and competition.
- like a wide variety of music
- like my computer.
- started a bit of coding a couple of years ago, for fun.
- know HTML, some Photoshop, Javascript, VBScript (that was before I knew it 
sucked), bit of CSS, XML.
- also recently started with PHP and discovered that it is not so hard as I 
thought it would be.
- am working on a msn messenger client in javascript and php (so far, I can 
login, and I'm kinda proud of this 'secret' project)
- want to study something related to the more creative side of information 
technologies, after finishing highschool.
- like pancakes very much, especially those with raisins and apples in it 
;).

And I'm willing to help you with Simuze, I'll do my best.

greetings,

Vincent Weevers
