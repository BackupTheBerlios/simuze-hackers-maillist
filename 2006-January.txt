Hi Bjorn,

I was already wondering why the svn repository was still empty. But now I'd 
say take it easy, or else you will not be able to work on Simuze ever 
again... That sounds a bit too negative but you get my point ;).

> You doing stuff really motivates me wanting to do more.

I'm very happy to hear that :).

A quick look at Vanilla showed me that they use a dictionary array, so let's 
do it that way ;). I have no experience in this area but when I read 
something about gettext on php.net (including the comments), I got the idea 
that implementing gettext isn't always that easy. So the dictionary array 
seems to be the best solution for now, I agree.

Greetings, Vincent
