Subject: [Simuze-hackers] sm_moderate.php: reject (weigeren nummer)
Message-ID: <005601c5ffd4$ca7daa30$9600000a@okl>

Ik hoop dat ik er goed aan doe hier code te posten. In ieder geval, hier is een opzet voor de code om een nummer te weigeren, in "admin/sm_moderate.php". Het volgt de development guidelines op de Simuze wiki niet. Het leek me niet handig, aangezien de rest van sm_moderate.php die guidelines ook niet volgt. Verder staat er nog wat commentaar tussen de code.

===========================

Hi,

Bedankt voor je code en je mailtje! Ik ga het asap in de site 
implementeren. Dit is de juiste plek om code te plaatsen of om tech 
vragen te stellen. Maak je geen zorgen om de guidelines, deze waren 
vooral opgezet als een doel waar we naartoe willen werken.

ps: Eigenlijk willen we proberen de tech lijst internationaal te gaan 
maken dus laten we in het vervolg Engels schrijven ;)

ps2: Hoe heet je eigenlijk :)

Subject: [Simuze-hackers] XSPF Playlists
Message-ID: <002501c601a1$9e004ca0$9600000a@okl>

Hi all,

Okay, I'll talk English ;). Sorry, forgot to mention my name: it's Vincent.

Are you planning to put the playlists in a database? It would make deleting and changing the playlists a lot easier. If the player needs to read playlists in the XSPF format, php can dynamically generate such xspf files after quering the database.

Greetings, Vincent

Hi Vincent,

Good point.

At the time I wrote the XSPF generator in such a way that it will 
generate a XSPF file to the filesystem and keep its contents in the db. 
So we could/can do nifty stuff with this data, for example a 
recommedation service a la Amazon. The reason to do both is to cache the 
playlists and lower the load on the db for the not so nifty stuff, ie 
playing the playlist repeatedly.

So to answer your question: yes the playlist are part of the db but not 
as a file, but rather as relations. I have the feeling this is stil 
quite a good balance between playlist management and db access.

To clarify something else: I'm working on organising the Svn repository 
in such a way that we can develop on Simuze v2 and still fix stuff in 
Simuze v1. So the repository could be a mess until then. Just so you know.

BTW we would really appreciate any thoughts from you on Simuze v2.

Are you using Simuze v1?

Hello Bjorn,

Sounds perfectly balanced to me. But, correct me if I'm wrong, if you want 
to update the playlist, you would need to change the contents of the db and 
also generate a new XSPF file.

And about the Simuze versions: I didn't know that there are different 
versions, and what their purpose is. And at this moment the svn repository 
seems pretty empty. Please tell me more about this (or is there something on 
the internet that I can read?)

Greetings, Vincent W.

PS. Can you also tell me something about the people involved in Simuze (for 
example, how many?), if you don't mind?

Yep, thats true. But at this point users cannot change the contents of 
the playlist, so in the end we probably have to investigate what works 
better. For now this seems to work quite well.

> And about the Simuze versions: I didn't know that there are different

Well, this was discussed offlist between Marten and me, so nobody knew 
about it until now ;).

The reason for having two versions is that Simuze v1 is the one that we 
use at http:/www.simuze.nl/live and the Simuze v2 will be its successor.

The differences:

Simuze v1 is made in php4 and more or less hacked together. It works but 
its a pain to maintain or update this version. For example we have glued 
some code between Simuze and Wordpress, created a cron based deamon that 
takes care of the music encoding/anti-virus stuff etc. It works for us, 
we know what to do, but if anybody else wants to help out it's almost 
impossible for them. So we want to maintain version 1 and start with the 
development of version 2 and learn from our misstakes.

Simuze v2 will probably be built in php5 and we will use a more OO based 
approach. One of the things we will do this time is focus on the core 
functionality of Simuze and implement some sort of plugin system for 
everything outside this core.

As you might notice a lot is still open for discussion. I would like to 
discuss this further so any ideas, plans feel free...

> And at this moment the svn 
> repository seems pretty empty. 

Correct. I made a misstake and this resulted in a not usable SVN repos. 
Berlios helped me out and the SVN repos can be used again. I will import 
Simuze v1 back in again tomorrow and also create a Simuze v2 branch.


Please tell me more about this (or is
> there something on the internet that I can read?)

There is getting more and more at the Simuze Wiki 
(http://simuze.berlios.de) about the proposed ideas and methodology. 
Feel free to send comments on this list or add your thoughts to the wiki.


> PS. Can you also tell me something about the people involved in Simuze 
> (for example, how many?), if you don't mind?

No problem.

We started with two: Marten Timan and me. After a while we had some 
people on the old mailinglist who wanted to help out, but we had no idea 
how to do this considering the state of Simuze, so in the end this kinda 
faded away (Can't blame them..) and we're now with three? If you would 
like to help out with Simuze v2 ;)

If you don't mind me asking, can you tell a bit more about yourself like 
skills, preferences, favourite pancake ;)

Hi Bjorn,

A couple of months ago I send a email to Marten, describing my interest in 
Simuze and some other stuff. Reading it again now, it sounds a bit to 
enthousiastic. For a couple of months I didn't do anything with Simuze, so 
the best thing is to just forget about that email ;). Anyway, I sorta 
regained my interest and became a member of the simuze-hackers list. I'm 
sorry to hear that there are not so much Simuze developers, but let's try to 
make the best of it.

> The reason for having two versions is that Simuze v1 is the one that we

What will be the priority? v1 or v2? And will you (or may I say 'we') start 
with v2 from scratch?

> Simuze v2 will probably be built in php5 and we will use a more OO based

Sounds good, but it's going to take some time...

And this plugin system, couldn't it simply be based on events. For example, 
if someone wants to add a RSS function, he would write this:

----------------------

     $Simuze->addHandler('onPlaylistUpdate','updateRSS');

     function updateRSS()
     {
          //generate new rss file, etcetera
     }

----------------------

> If you don't mind me asking, can you tell a bit more about yourself like 
> skills, preferences, favourite pancake ;)

Sure. In short:

I...
- am 17 years old.
- am still at school, Atheneum 5
- used to play drums, nowadays I play in a local percussionband.
- play volleyball, training and competition.
- like a wide variety of music
- like my computer.
- started a bit of coding a couple of years ago, for fun.
- know HTML, some Photoshop, Javascript, VBScript (that was before I knew it 
sucked), bit of CSS, XML.
- also recently started with PHP and discovered that it is not so hard as I 
thought it would be.
- am working on a msn messenger client in javascript and php (so far, I can 
login, and I'm kinda proud of this 'secret' project)
- want to study something related to the more creative side of information 
technologies, after finishing highschool.
- like pancakes very much, especially those with raisins and apples in it 
;).

And I'm willing to help you with Simuze, I'll do my best.

greetings,

Vincent Weevers

As more code gets developed and becomes useful I expect more people to 
get interested in this project. I mean most Open Source projects start 
out with just one person and usually don't grow that much bigger...so 
we'll see.

V1 will be mostly Marten's and my responsibility. Version 2 is open for 
all and I want to start from scratch. I have been looking at Vanilla 
(http://getvanilla.com) and I kinda like the way it has been programmed, 
so we might even built upon some classes from Vanilla if that's 
convienent ;)

Yeah, but what would I else be doing? Have a social life...tsss come on :)

Thats a possible solution. I honestlt must say that I don't have a clue 
yet on how to create an easy to use plugin system, but I'm sure we will 
come up with a nice solution.

Welcome aboard :)!

Hello Bjorn,

I have written a simple page on the wiki 
(http://simuze.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Development:future), thought it 
would be convenient to write down the basic ideas. I also presumed that 
Simuze v2 will be implementing some language/translation system. And I wish 
you happy holidays, best wishes etc etc.

Greetings,

Vincent

Hi Vincent.

Thanks! I've been planning to work more on Simuze but I had some serious 
issues with my main development machine and on top of that I suffer from 
some back pains so I'm not so much working on Simuze right now.

You doing stuff really motivates me wanting to do more.

Your right about the translation aspect. I'm thinking of either gettext 
(PO files a la Wordpress) or using file with a dictionary array (name 
value pairs). Any experiences with these? For now I would go for the 
latter out of laziness...

Best wishes and see ya next year ;)

grtz
