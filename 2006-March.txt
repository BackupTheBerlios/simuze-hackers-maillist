Hej Bjorn,

I now roughly have the same versions as you do. Version 5 of mysql is indeed 
not very widespread, but you don't see php5 everywhere either. But as long 
as mysql 4.1 will be enough, we can use it.

The input class is not in my favor anymore. If one would use the input class 
to put data into the database, which class would he use to get data out of 
the database? I'm searching for a simple basic object model, but I'm 
starting to think that's not possible. Anyway, I've put a quickly drawn 
class diagram on the wiki and a very limited validation class in the svn 
repository. The class diagram seems messy (and it is), nearly no relations 
are drawn and I hope I used the right symbols and all, but it's a start. By 
the way, your code says WriterHTML but in a later mail you said HTMLWriter. 
The latter seems more obvious, what's the official name? Also, I figured the 
Writer class could also be extended by a EmailWriter class.

What are your ideas about a user/session class? And there also has to be a 
class for accessing properties of other users. What are you thinking?

greetings, Vincent

PS. I want to change my email-address in the simuze-hackers list, should I 
just unsubscribe and then subscribe with my new emailaddress? I'll be in the 
digested members list if I do that, don't know what that means.

He Vincent,

Sorry for the delay, at the moment its quite hectic because I'm doing 
some projects besides work and Simuze.

Oh, MySQL 5 is very interesting, but for our purposes I think we don't 
need the new features of MySQL 5 so thats also part of the reason to 
stick with 4.x

I've been looking into some info about the way that we can handle these 
things without re-inventing the wheel over and over again, maybe we 
should investigate our options a bit more widely and see if there are 
any nicely coded and not too bloated frameworks (Symphony?) or libs that 
can help us with this. On the other hand its also very nice if we can 
setup a system that does exactly as we wish and not be (too) depended on 
external parties.

As for your class diagram and your code I'll look into it tonight, as I 
am now typing this in the train and I don't have any WiFi..so I can't 
check it right now.

I agree on the name issue. Lets go for more logical and rename the class 
to HTMLWriter instead of WriterHTML. I used the latter to make clear its 
an extension of the Writer class, but its confusing..so we change it :)

My idea about a session/user class is that we basically should have only 
one global var in the session that handles everything that has to do 
with Simuze. Ie this global var contains all the instances we would 
need..but maybe we should test this first.

ps: Digest means that you will get all the emails of one day in one 
email instead of each email seperately. You can change this option as 
you see fit.

He Vincent,

The class looks neat. Have you tried to write some tests for it with 
phpunit, already? I will upload my documentation about it on the wiki 
tonight. The diagram is not that clear to me yet, I'll try to work with 
and build further upon it. Don't worry about the symbols and that stuff, 
as long as you use a consistent system and explain it (legenda) it will 
work, because we 'only' need it to communicate our ideas and not compete 
for the best looking diagram ;)

take care,

grtz
BjornW

The wheel gets reinvented an awfull lot of times... A framework can help us, 
though indeeed we don't want overhead. I've been googling a bit, I stumbled 
upon this: http://www.mustap.com/phpzone_post_73_top-10-php-mvc-frameworks: 
Symfony is the winner. We must determine whether it's usable for us. I'm 
worried about extensions for Simuze, how that will go with a framework. 
Another option would be to 'borrow' some classes from Lussumo.

PHPUnit is still waiting for my dive into it, sorry. The diagram is indeed a 
bit vague, it's a UML class-diagram and I'm new to that too.

Vincent,

At the pace that we're developing Simuze v2 we need to find a framework 
that takes a lot of time of our hands without too much overhead, so we 
can focus on the important stuff. I'm going to try out Symphony, because 
  I will need a php framework anyhow for some of my projects. The things 
I am looking for in a framework are:

- license (open ssource)
- easy to extend
- easy to distribute (PEAR?)
- easy to translate
- easy to update (uses rsync for updating a live site..and the framework 
itself can be updated using PEAR)
- easy to test (phpunit or similar)
- easy to document (phpDocumentor for instance)

and it seems that Symphony does this.I also found this podcast about 
Symphony, haven't listened to it yet:

http://podcast.phparch.com/main/index.php/episodes:20060210

Would you also please try out Symphony and tell us what you think about it?

grtz
BjornW
